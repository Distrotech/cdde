Version 0.2.0
=============
11/17/04
* Made CDDE into a daemon. All output besides command-line errors are sent via
  syslog
* Sometime since last year libxml changed it's aclocal file so I had to update
  the required version to 2.6.13 (what I happen to have on my system)

Version 0.1.0
=============
10/24/03
* Changed config file format. It is NOT backwards-compatible. Sorry about that.
  Now you can different commands for each drive. I also got rid of a couple of
  tags, so the format is much simpler.

10/21/03
* Added man pages. See cdde(1) and cdde.xml(5)
  Thanks Grant Sewell <g.sewell@thymox.uklinux.net>!
* Added command-line option to run commands for discs already in drive.
  Thanks Pete Shinners <pete@shinners.org>!
* Fixed polling delay so it wouldn't sleep initially.
* Added a batch mode. Will check all drives once then exit immediately.
  Use the '-b' command-line option.


Version 0.0.7
=============
1/05/03
* Increased default wait time while polling
* Added SVCD support
  Thanks Piergiorgio Ghezzo <PJ@piggei.com>!
* Changed how disc_has_dir works. It doesn't use mount, so the program no longer
  needs to be setuid root!
  Thanks Charles Vaughn <charlesv@mfos.org>!

  
Version 0.0.6
=============
12/05/02
* Made it remove a drive from the list when it can't access a drive.
  Thanks Martin Rasp <martin.rasp@nettwork.com>!


Version 0.0.5
=============
11/13/02
* I forgot to malloc() something in 0.0.4 causing it to crash whenever you 
  insert a data (including dvd/vcd) disc. I fixed this.
  Thanks Martin Rasp <martin.rasp@nettwork.com>!
* lowered libxml dependency to 2.4.19 because I got reports of it working on
  debian 3.0


Version 0.0.4
=============
11/12/02
* added command-line options (now can specify alternate config file)
