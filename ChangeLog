=============
10/24/03
* Changed config file format. It is NOT backwards-compatible. Sorry about that.

  tags, so the format is much simpler.

  Thanks Grant Sewell <g.sewell@thymox.uklinux.net>!
* Added command-line option to run commands for discs already in drive.
  Thanks Pete Shinners <pete@shinners.org>!

* Added a batch mode. Will check all drives once then exit immediately.
  Use the '-b' command-line option.

=============
1/05/03
* Increased default wait time while polling
* Added SVCD support
  Thanks Piergiorgio Ghezzo <PJ@piggei.com>!

  Thanks Charles Vaughn <charlesv@mfos.org>!

=============
11/12/02
