\fBcdde.xml\fR \- Configuration file for cdde
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
When cdde is run for the first time, an example xml configuration file
(~/.cdde.xml) is created for you:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
.br
<cdde delay="5000000">
  <drive path="/dev/cdrom">
    <audio command="xmessage audio disc was inserted."/>
    <data command="xmessage data disc was inserted."/>
    <dvd command="xmessage dvd disc was inserted."/>
    <mixed command="xmessage mixed disc was inserted."/>
    <blank command="xmessage blank disc was inserted."/>
    <vcd command="xmessage vcd disc was inserted."/>
    <svcd command="xmessage svcd disc was inserted."/>
    <unknown command="xmessage unknown disc was inserted."/>
  </drive>
.br
</cdde>

This default file is not very useful, and so I suggest you to edit it to your needs before
running cdde again.  You may add as many drive entries, or commands as you like.
If multiple entries are found for a type of disc then all entries will be
run in the order they are found.

The specific device in use can be passed to the command with one of the following special tags:

  %dev%  \-  is replaced with the device name of the cdrom that
            just had a disc inserted
            
  %mnt%  \-  is replaced with the listed mount point for the
            cdrom that just had a disc inserted
 
Note:   %mnt% is determined through your fstab (usually located in /etc) file. If you do not have a listing for each <drive> in the fstab this will cause problems.

This way, you can tell your video player which device to use when playing a VCD, for example.
