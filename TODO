These are upcoming changes/features in no particular order.
Please email me any suggestions at <eric@ericlathrop.com>

Polish
------
* start using version control
* make it guess cd drives from fstab when generating sample config files

Features
--------
* add support for a command to execute when a disc is ejected
* see if there's any nice way of un-locking the cdrom drive's door
  and letting the drive eject without having to unmount the disc.
  i have a feeling this will be pretty nasty to do, if anyone out there
  knows anything I'd appreciate _any_ info.
* support auto-ejecting (see ioctl CDROMEJECT_SW in cdrom.h)
