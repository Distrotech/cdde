.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
cdde is a program that detects when a cdrom drive on your system has had a
disc inserted.

When it finds a disc inserted in the drive it will attempt to determine the
type of the disc, and execute a specified command.

This means you can put in a dvd and your favorite dvd software will start,
or put in a data cd and it will be automatically mounted for you.

Right now cdde can detect the following types of discs:
        * audio cd
        * data cd
        * dvd
        * mixed audio/data cd
        * vcd
        * svcd
        * blank cdr/dvdr

For now the dvd checking is just a bit of magic that checks to see if there's
a "video_ts" directory on the disc. Same goes for the vcd checking: it just
looks for a "vcd" directory on the disc.

cdde reads its configuration from "~/.cdde.xml" unless otherwise specified on
the command line.
